Apollo Server and GraphQL! structure your backend code in a more professional and scalable way. I'll guide you through setting up a clean architecture with Apollo Server and GraphQL, as well as how to handle requests in a manner that feels like you're working with REST (with controllers, routes, and separation of concerns).

```bash
yarn add apollo-server graphql mongoose
```

Project Structure
A common and clean project structure for Apollo Server and GraphQL can look like this:

```powershell
src/
│
├── graphql/
│   ├── resolvers/
│   │   ├── userResolver.js
│   ├── typeDefs/
│   │   └── userTypeDefs.js
│   ├── schema.js
│
├── models/
│   └── userModel.js
│
├── services/
│   └── userService.js
│
└── index.js
```

# Conclusion

Now, with this architecture:

- **TypeDefs** are for defining your schema.
- **Resolvers** handle the GraphQL queries and mutations.
- **Services** manage business logic and database interactions.
- **Models** define how your data is structured in the database.

This approach is modular and clean, similar to how you organized your Express REST APIs. It keeps your GraphQL implementation maintainable, professional, and scalable.

Let me know if you need further assistance with any part!

# NOTE

In this case, using MongoDB is a good fit, as it works well with GraphQL due to its flexible schema and easy integration with Apollo Server.

MySQL requires a fixed schema, which can be less flexible for **GraphQL** dynamic query nature compared to MongoDB's schema-less design.
