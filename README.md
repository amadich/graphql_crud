Apollo Server and GraphQL! structure your backend code in a more professional and scalable way. I'll guide you through setting up a clean architecture with Apollo Server and GraphQL, as well as how to handle requests in a manner that feels like you're working with REST (with controllers, routes, and separation of concerns).

```bash
yarn add apollo-server graphql mongoose
```

Project Structure
A common and clean project structure for Apollo Server and GraphQL can look like this:

```powershell
src/
│
├── graphql/
│   ├── resolvers/
│   │   ├── userResolver.js
│   ├── typeDefs/
│   │   └── userTypeDefs.js
│   ├── schema.js
│
├── models/
│   └── userModel.js
│
├── services/
│   └── userService.js
│
└── index.js
```



## Setup PostgreSQL

### 1. Install PostgreSQL
If you don't have PostgreSQL installed, follow the installation guide for your operating system from the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

### 2. Create a PostgreSQL database

Once PostgreSQL is installed, you'll need to create a database for your project. You can do this using the `psql` command line tool:

```bash
# Switch to the PostgreSQL user
sudo -u postgres psql

# Create a new database (e.g., "backpack")
CREATE DATABASE backpack;

# Create a user and grant privileges
CREATE USER root WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE backpack TO root;

# Exit psql
\q
```

### 3. Configure the Sequelize connection

In your project, make sure the database connection is configured correctly. In the `src/db.js` file, you should have a `Sequelize` setup like this:

```js
import { Sequelize } from 'sequelize';

// Replace with your own database credentials
const sequelize = new Sequelize('postgres://root:yourpassword@localhost:5432/backpack', {
  dialect: 'postgres',
  logging: false,  // Optional: Disable SQL logging
});

export default sequelize;
```

### 4. Run migrations (optional)

If you have defined any Sequelize migrations (which are not shown in your current setup), you can run them with:

```bash
yarn sequelize db:migrate
# or if you use npm
# npm run sequelize db:migrate
```

## Running the Project

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
yarn start
# or if you're using npm
# npm start
```

This will start the Apollo Server on `http://localhost:5000`.

## GraphQL Queries & Mutations

Once the server is running, you can open the GraphQL Playground at `http://localhost:5000` and test the following queries and mutations.

### Example Query - Fetch Users:

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    username
    email
  }
}
```

### Example Mutation - Create a User:

```graphql
mutation CreateUser($registerInput: RegisterInput!) {
  createUser(registerInput: $registerInput) {
    username
    email
  }
}
```

Variables:

```json
{
  "registerInput": {
    "username": "john_doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }
}
```

### Additional Notes

- The instructions assume you have PostgreSQL installed locally. If you use Docker or a different PostgreSQL setup, adjust the connection details accordingly.
- You can enhance this README with more details based on your project requirements, such as specific migrations, environment variables, or any additional configuration steps.

Once you've made this README, simply add it to your repository:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README file with setup instructions"
git push origin main
```

This will ensure anyone (including you) who works on the project in the future will know exactly how to get started with PostgreSQL and GraphQL.

# Conclusion

Now, with this architecture:

- **TypeDefs** are for defining your schema.
- **Resolvers** handle the GraphQL queries and mutations.
- **Services** manage business logic and database interactions.
- **Models** define how your data is structured in the database.

This approach is modular and clean, similar to how you organized your Express REST APIs. It keeps your GraphQL implementation maintainable, professional, and scalable.

Let me know if you need further assistance with any part!

# NOTE

In this case, using MongoDB is a good fit, as it works well with GraphQL due to its flexible schema and easy integration with Apollo Server.

MySQL requires a fixed schema, which can be less flexible for **GraphQL** dynamic query nature compared to MongoDB's schema-less design.
